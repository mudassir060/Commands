-d                        - directs command to the only connected USB device...
-e                        - directs command to the only running emulator...
-s <serial number>        ...

adb devices | tail -n +2 | cut -sf 1 | xargs -IX adb -s X install -r com.myAppPackage // Install the given app on all connected devices.
