#### This command generates a model named 'User' with specified attributes: name, email, phoneNo, type, id, and profile.
  sequelize model:generate --name User --attributes name:String,email:String,phoneNo:String,type:String,id:integer,profile:String

### 17. Create a New Migration
#### This command generates a new migration file for handling schema changes in your database.
  sequelize migration:generate --name create-users-table

### 18. Run Migrations
#### This command applies all pending migrations, syncing the database schema with your models.
  sequelize db:migrate

### 19. Create a New Seeder
#### This command generates a seeder file for populating the database with initial data.
  sequelize seed:generate --name demo-user

### 20. Run Seeders
#### This command executes all seeder files, populating the database with predefined data.
  sequelize db:seed:all

### 21. Undo Last Migration
#### This command rolls back the last migration applied to the database.
  sequelize db:migrate:undo

### 22. Undo All Migrations
#### This command rolls back all migrations, effectively resetting the database schema to its initial state.
  sequelize db:migrate:undo:all

### 23. Undo Last Seeder
#### This command rolls back the last seeder applied to the database.
  sequelize db:seed:undo

### 24. Undo All Seeders
#### This command rolls back all seeders, effectively clearing all seeded data from the database.
  sequelize db:seed:undo:all

### 25. Generate a New Controller (optional)
#### While not a built-in Sequelize feature, you can manually create a controller to handle the logic for your models.
#### For example, you might create a file `controllers/userController.js` for managing user-related actions.
  touch controllers/userController.js

### 26. Setup Express Router (optional)
#### Express routers allow you to organize your route handlers into modular, mountable route handlers.
#### For example, you might create a file `routes/userRoutes.js` to handle user routes.
  touch routes/userRoutes.js

### 27. Start the Express Server
#### This command starts your Express server by running the main entry point of your application, usually `app.js` or `index.js`.
  node app.js

### 28. Install Nodemon (optional)
#### Nodemon automatically restarts your Node.js application when file changes are detected, making development more efficient.
  npm install --save-dev nodemon

### 29. Run the Server with Nodemon
#### This command starts your application with Nodemon, allowing it to automatically restart when changes are made.
  npx nodemon app.js

### 30. Install Jest for Testing (optional)
#### Jest is a delightful JavaScript testing framework with a focus on simplicity. This command installs Jest and saves it as a development dependency.
  npm install --save-dev jest

### 31. Install Supertest for Testing HTTP (optional)
#### Supertest provides a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP, working with any test framework. This command installs Supertest and saves it as a development dependency.
  npm install --save-dev supertest

  npx jest

### 33. Install ESLint (optional)
#### ESLint is a tool for identifying and fixing problems in your JavaScript code. This command installs ESLint and saves it as a development dependency.
  npm install --save-dev eslint

### 34. Initialize ESLint
#### This command configures ESLint in your project, creating an ESLint configuration file.
  npx eslint --init

### 35. Lint Your Code
#### This command runs ESLint on your codebase to check for code quality and style issues.
  npx eslint .

### 36. Install Prettier for Code Formatting (optional)
#### Prettier is an opinionated code formatter that enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it. This command installs Prettier and saves it as a development dependency.
  npm install --save-dev prettier

### 37. Format Your Code with Prettier
#### This command formats your codebase according to Prettier's rules.
  npx prettier --write .

### 38. Install PM2 for Production (optional)
#### PM2 is a production process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer. This command installs PM2 globally.
  npm install -g pm2

### 39. Start Your Application with PM2
#### This command launches your application with PM2, ensuring it stays online and managing restarts if it crashes.
  pm2 start app.js

 ```
 DB_HOST=localhost
 DB_USER=root
 DB_PASS=password
 ```

### 43. Load Environment Variables in Your Application
#### This command ensures that environment variables from your .env file are loaded into your application.
  echo "require('dotenv').config();" >> app.js
